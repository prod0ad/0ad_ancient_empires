	<History>Pike, or sarissa, infantry were developed by Philip II of Macedon based on the hoplite of the Greek city-states. The Macedonian pikemen, or phalangites, wielded an extra long spear (sarissa) approximatly 4 to 7 meters (13â€“21 feet) in length. Because of it's length and weight, the pike required the use of both hands, so the shield was slung over the pikeman's shoulder with a leather strap. Front-line pikemen of the age were generally highly-armored, while those in the back lines were lightly armored. Such pike-wielding troops were employed by numerous states, from Carthage to Syria, and were used to fix enemy infantry in position while the army's cavalry worked to turn the enemy flanks.</History>
