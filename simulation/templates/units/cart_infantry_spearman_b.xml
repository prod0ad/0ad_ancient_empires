    <History>The core of the Carthaginian army was made up of Liby-Phoenicians, Africans with Phoenician ancestors. The wealthy residents of Carthage recruited the non-citizen Liby-Phoenicians as heavy infantry, fighting in the phalanx armed with the long spear. Armor could range from chain mail hauberks to bronze cuirasses and helmets often included the latest Hellenistic types. Although armed with a shield and a sword, Carthaginian swordsmen were woefully ill-trained compared to their Roman or Iberian counterparts in fencing.</History>
