    <History>Egyptian women of ancient times had legal and economic rights in parity with Egyptian men. They could own slaves and property and when wed to their husband they did not automatically become his property as was the case in many other ancient and modern cultures. It is interesting to note that when the Greco-Macedonians conquered Egypt in the 4th century B.C., Egyptian women continued to retain their liberal economic and legal rights while Greek women who also lived in Egypt were subject to the rule of traditional Greek law.</History>
