    <History>Peltasts were javelinists originating in Thrace but their form of combat was widely copied by the Hellenes, Macedonians, and Persians. Equipped with a small oval or crescent shield, a peltast would charge at enemy formations whilst hurling his javelins then fall back to avoid close combat. They wore no armor and were at a significant disadvantage against heavy infantry and cavalry, relying on their speed and skill for survival. Thracians sold their services to Hellene cities as mercenaries and added a much needed ranged and skirmishing ability to Hellenic armies.</History>
