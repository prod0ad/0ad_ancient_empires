    <History>The best cavalry in Greece, besides the Macedonian hetairoi. Thessalians led an agrarian life and raised horses in the large pasture lands of Thessaly. They were widely regarded as the best cavalry in all of Hellas due to the speed and tenacity of their horses. They were used effectively in the Macedonian armies as light cavalry and held the important left flank of the battle line, staving off enemy advances long enough for the heavy cavalry on the right flank to make the killer blow.</History>
