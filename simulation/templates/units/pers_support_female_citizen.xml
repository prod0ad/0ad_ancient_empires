    <History>Persian women were fairly powerful during the reign of the Achaemenids, having substantial control over their future. A husband was not able to pawn his wife off to cover debts, nor was did he have control of her possessions. Persian women owned property and were quite active in their management of it, which could include female-induced divorce. Veiling had a long tradition in ancient Persia although it was only a sign of modesty and wealth among well-to-do women with none of the modern implications.</History>
